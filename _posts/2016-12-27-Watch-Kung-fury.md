Recursion
```java
 public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        
        System.out.print(factorial(n));
    }
    
    public static long factorial( int n ){
        return (n == 1) ? 1 : n*factorial(n-1) ;
    }
```


Binary Numbers
```java
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
int n = in.nextInt();
int counter = 0, max =0;
while (n > 0) {
    int rem = n%2;
    if (rem==1) counter++; 
    else counter=0;
    max = Math.max(counter, max);
    n/=2;
}
System.out.println(max);
```
